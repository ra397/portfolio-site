      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a senior studying Computer Science and Engineering. I’m passionate about building custom software solutions that 
        drive businesses and research forward. What I love most about computer science is how easy it is to apply what I’ve learned—anytime, 
        anywhere. Just open a laptop and start coding. This freedom to experiment is the root of my passion for software development.
